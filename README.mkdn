Getting Started
---------------

To get started with OrionOS, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the OrionOS trees, use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/TeamOrion/platform_manifest.git -b n


Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync

You may track qcom common repo locally, as some devices need different ones.
